# Election Audit with Python

## Overview of Election Audit

### Background
We have been helping Tom, an employee from Colorado Board of Election to audit the election results for US congressional precinct in Colorado. The results are tabulated and were given to us as [csv file resource](https://github.com/weihaolun/election-analysis/blob/161dd8acccf89241788970adec1b838c3c1545a3/Resources/election_results.csv).

Previously, we have completed following parts of auditing using Python script:
-	Total number of votes received.
-	A list of voted candidates’ names with number of votes and the percentage of votes they received.
-	A summary of election winner results: winning candidate’s name, winning vote count and winning percentage.
-	Printed and saved above results to a text file (as screenshot below).

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to complete the election audit using Python by adding the following parts:
-	The voter turnout for each county.
-	The percentage of votes from each county.
-	The county with the highest county.
-	Print and save above results to the text file [election_results.txt](https://github.com/weihaolun/election-analysis/blob/161dd8acccf89241788970adec1b838c3c1545a3/analysis/election_results.txt).

The following sections of this report will address the overall results of the election audit, and a recommendation summary of re-using the script for future elections.

## Election-Audit Results
- **How many votes were cast in this congressional election?**
- **Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.**
- **Which county had the largest number of votes?**
- **Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.**
- **Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?**
